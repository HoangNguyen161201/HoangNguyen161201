I am very passionate about programming, especially web development. I have been trying to develop myself to fulfill my dream. Currently, I am focusing on javascript language mainly and have had many good projects. My dream in the future is to know more about mobile application programming and better understand C# to become a more multi-talented programmer. Please follow me.
